2k) Declare an empty dictionary, then iterate over your list. For each number, check if the number is already in the 
dictionary. If it is, increment its value by 1. If it is not, add it to the dictionary with a value of 1.
With that, you just counted the frequency of each number in the list! Print the entire dictionary, and print the type 
of the dictionary.
